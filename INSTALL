Installation
============

* system-wide
	+ tar xvfz KBtin-0.4.0.tar.gz
	  If you have an ancient version of tar, you may need to ungzip
	  the archive manually first:
		+ gzip -d KBtin-0.4.0.tar.gz
		+ tar xvf KBtin-0.4.0.tar
	+ ./configure
	+ make install (as root)

* per-user
	+ Untar the archive (as above)
	+ ./configure
	Then either:
	+ make bin
		to install to ~/bin
	+ make
	+ Copy both the KBtin binary and KBtin_help.gz to a directory
	  of your choice.
		to install to another place


Dependencies
============

While KBtin will compile with nothing but the compiler and make, there are
optional libraries that enable certain features:
* gnutls: SSL connectivity
* zlib: on-the-wire compression on most MUDs
* glib: some speed-up
On Debian systems, the relevant packages are named: libgnutls28-dev,
libz-dev, libglib2.0-dev.  If your system puts them in some weird place,
installing pkg-config may help.


Cross-compiling notes
=====================

KBtin is not completely cross-compile clean at this moment.  The problems
involve guessing the /dev/pty ranges (needed only on BSD systems) and
building manual.html.  The latter is not built by default, though.
