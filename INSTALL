Installation
============

* as root
	+ tar xvfz KBtin-0.4.0.tar.gz
	  If you have an ancient version of tar, you may need to ungzip
	  the archive manually first:
		+ gzip -d KBtin-0.4.0.tar.gz
		+ tar xvf KBtin-0.4.0.tar
	+ ./configure
	+ make install

* as ordinary user
	+ Untar the archive (as above)
	+ ./configure
	+ make
	+ Copy both the KBtin binary and KBtin_help.gz to a directory
	  of your choice.

Cross-compiling notes
=====================

KBtin is not completely cross-compile clean at this moment.  The problems
involve guessing the /dev/pty ranges (needed only on BSD systems) and
building manual.html.  The latter is not built by default, though.
