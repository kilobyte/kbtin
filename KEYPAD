Unfortunately, while most terminals claim vt100 compatibility, they
lot of them lack the so-called "application cursor mode".  This is
the only reasonable portable to use the keypad arrows, so #keypad won't
work on those terminals.

Terminals I checked:

* Linux console:
    works just fine

* PuTTY:
    works just fine

* aterm:
    works just fine

* rxvt:
    never versions work fine, older ones have a bug that causes the
    down arrow to be misreported as the diagonal up-left one.  This
    bug is hard-coded in rxvt -- so the only option that doesn't
    involve patching the source is upgrading to a never version.

* wterm:
    it's based on old rxvt code, and I'm not aware of a fixed version.
    Of course, you can just get the sources and apply this patch:

    requires some tinkering with xmodmap.  It seems that feeding the following
    to xmodmap will make #keypad work (making the NumLock key stuck as a side
    effect, though).

(thanks Elariel for this solution!)
