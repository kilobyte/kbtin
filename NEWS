1.0.1:
* Fixed a problem with all input being hidden on MUDs like Genesis or
  Arkadia due to telnet echo settings.
* Fixed a bug where highlights before/after a letter character didn't
  work properly ("#highlight red /d/mordor/" failed to highlight both
  "/testmud/d/mordor/" and "/d/mordor/morannon/").  Highlights inside
  a word are still suppressed, though (no "ash" inside of "Bashgeroy").

1.0.2:
* Tons of bugfixes.
* The allowed level of recursion is limited to 256.  Yeah, this can
  break some functionality, but it's better to cut off a run-away alias
  than to get a segfault.
* If your terminal happens to support underline and/or italics, you
  can use them in your highlights/whatever.  Of course, if the MUD
  happens to use these codes, they'll work, too.

1.0.3:
* #timecommand can help profile your scripts.
* The "Esc" key will no longer work.  In fact, it can produce bad keycodes.
  Sorry, but due to ancient VT100 design quirks, Esc conflicts with a lot of
  other keys.  Besides, almost no Unix programs handle it correctly anyway.
  If this bothers you, you can define BARE_ESC in tintin.h; that will
  break all key sequences involving Alt.
* A number of new editing keys has been added.
* You can now #bind Alt-Key.

1.0.4:
* #grep, true regexp match.
* #retain, zMud-like behaviour of the input box.

1.0.5:
* Bugfixes, bugfixes, bugfixes.  Even a remote buffer overflow fixed.
* You can start a new session (-s, -r) or execute a command (-c) when
  invoking KBtin -- peruse the new, shiny man page.
* #pretick -- control the '#10 SECONDS TO TICK' messages
* New inlines: #grep, #match and #strcmp can be used in expressions.
* #collate and #expand can save you writing hairy scripts when converting
  to and from TMI2 style (3ne,4e,s) and ;-based (10n;10n;e;s;e) aliases.
* You can add '#hook's to be notified of events such as:
  OPEN		session opening,
  CLOSE		session closing (so you can save your config)
  ZAP           session being aborted (#zap, #end, ^C, etc)
  SEND          text being sent to the MUD (so you can use it for mapping
                without having to alias everything).
  ACTIVATE      switching sessions
  DEACTIVATE       ''        ''
* #logcomment, for writing things to the log

1.0.6:
* Commands are now case-insensitive, for zMud compatibility.
* Bugfixes, as always.
* KBtin should be more responsive when under heavy local load or when the
  server suffers from CPU lag.
* #gagthis, to remove the current line from within an action (just like
  zMud's #gag).
* Logging enhancements:
	+ appending to a log (>>logfile)
	+ logging to a pipe (|logger)
	+ logging through bzip2 (logfile.bz2)
	+ #logtype, allowing you to switch between cr/lf, lf (previously
	  a compile-time option) and ttyrec.
* Added ttyrec2ansi, a filter to strip the timing information from ttyrec
  files.

1.0.6a:
* Oops... #log didn't obey $variables.
