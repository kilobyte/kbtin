0.2.4:
* boolean toggles: can be set/reset in addition to toggle (#blank 1 and so on)
  Boolean values: 1/0, TRUE/FALSE, ON/OFF, YES/NO
* more things allowed before starting a session
* #route <from> <to> <path> [<distance>] and #goto <from> <to> commands added
* #goto <from> <to> can be abbreviated as from>to

0.2.4a:
* #remark does the same as #nop. I found myself writing #rem in my config
  files way too often *yawn*.
* conditional routes: #route <from> <to> <length> <condition>

0.2.4.0:
* Jakub Narebski (jnareb@jester.ds2.uw.edu.pl) joins KBtin development team

0.2.4.1:
* Added help from Tintin ver. 1.5 with little changes; ALL COMMANDS are listed
  there, some of them to be added to help, news and NEWS soon. This help is
  in file .tt_help.txt. Putting compressed file (.tt_help.txt.Z) in home
  directory will allow to use #help command
* help from Tintin 3.0 to be added; KBtin changes to be added.

0.2.4.2:
* added code from Happy Tintin++ by Sverre Normann (sverreno@stud.ntnu.no)
  x 'simulation' of secstotick variable: $secstotick will return number
    of seconds to tick (from tt's internal counter) provided no variable
    named 'secstotick' already exists
  - ${<string>} format to allow use of non-alpha characters in variable
    name
  - #listlength {destination variable} {list} command added
  - #getitem {destination variable} {item number} {list} command added;
    an item is either a word, or grouped words in {} braces;
    FORTRAN type indices (first element has index '1' not '0')
  - #reverse {destination variable} {string} command added 
  - #postpad {destination variable} {length} {text} command added, 
    truncates text to lenght and pads with spaces at the end if necessary
  - #prepad {destination variable} {length} {text} command added
* #isatom {destination variable} {list} command added; to be substituted
  by #if test
* #splitlist {head destination variable} {tail destination variable} 
  {list} [{number of elements head will have}] command added, with default
  head size = 1

0.2.5:
* #time and #ctime can be used also to give the representation of an
  arbitrary point of time: #[c]time <dest. variable> <time>
  Time can be given as a number of seconds, or in format '5y 3d 10h 6m 42s'.
* characters with codes 128-255 no longer display as weird blinking reversed
  things. Note that their usage should be strongly discouraged as these
  codes can have different meaning in different OSes/fonts, but some people
  seem to cannot type 'Baruk-Khazad Dum' instead of 'Barûk-Khazâd Dûm'.
* new editing keys:
  - Tab allows you to temporarily suspend typing a longer command-line until
    next use of Tab.
  - Esc clears the current input line.
* #finditem {dest. variable} {item} {list} command gives the index of 'item'
  in the 'list'. Result of 0 means that 'item' was not found.
* inline commands: #finditem and #listlength can be used inside expressions.
  Example: #if {#find $1 $enemies} {kill $1}

0.2.6:
* several bugfixes
* #deleteitem <dest. variable> <list> <item> command

0.2.7:                                           Sun May 07 02:20:36 CET 2000
* low-level text display completely rewritten, now uses ANSI codes instead
  of ncurses library

0.2.8:                                           Mon Jul 10 19:54:26 CET 2000
* #writesession now properly writes all changes (everything that differs
  from aliases/actions/ect. loaded before starting current session)
* multi-color highlights (#high 6/4 asshole)
* try appending .gz to the log name and see what happens :)

0.2.9:                                           Mon Jan  1 21:01:00 CET 2001
* #margin <left> <right> to help writing mails, etc
* actions, delays and binds ignore #verbatim mode now
* #bind <key> <function> allows you to assign function keys

0.3.0:                                           Wed Jan 24 19:55:00 CET 2001
* actions, substitutes and highlights are now guaranteed to fire
* number of color codes extended from 16 to 256 (backgrounds and blink)

0.3.1:                                           Mon Feb  5 23:13:00 CET 2001
* new system of background color codes. The color code syntax is: ~n~,
  n=0..255, or ~[a][:[b][:[c]]]~, a=0..15, b=0..7, c=0..1.
  Examples:
    14          yellow letters on black
    15:4        white letters on red background
    13:         pink letters, still red background
    14:0:1      blinking yellow letters on black
    ::0         yellow letters on black, no longer blinking
* #promptaction, actions which work for uncompleted lines

0.3.2:                                           Tue Mar 20 20:17:00 CET 2001
* #index now uses 1-based indices - for consitency with other commands
* #foreach {list} <command>
  Examples:
     #foreach {Omm Consola Murre Aethia} rescue

     #alias cc {#var message {$$0};#foreach {$clan} __cc}
     #alias __cc {tell $0 [clancomm] $message}

0.3.3:                                           Mon Mar 26 23:00:00 CET 2001
* pseudovariables $COLS and $LINES can be used to query the size of terminal
  window.  Note: size given is the raw window size (like 80x25), without
  subtracting one line for the input box and another for the status line.
* #strlen <var> <text> gives you the length of text.  It's an inline, too.
* #explode <var> <delimiter> <text> converts a text to a list
     {a,b,c d,e}      ---","--->    {a b {c d} e}
* #implode <var> <delimiter> <text> 
     {a b {c d} e}    ---","--->    {a,b,c d,e}
* #substr <var> <l>[,<r>] <text> instead of #index
* digits and underscores are now allowed in variable names
* $PATH pseudovariable queries the current path
* documentation - #help <command>

0.3.4:                                           Wed Mar 28 13:34:00 CET 2001
* #var, #math, #tolower, etc. work instantly now, instead of taking effect
  with the beginning of the next alias
* #foreach can now support more complex argument substitution.  Example:
     #foreach {{a 1} {b 2} {c 3}} {#var $1 $2}
* You can now split long lines in files read by #read:
  #alias abc {
                 a;
                 b;
                 c
             }

0.3.5:                                           Thu Apr  5 15:21:42 CET 2001
* "#var a {$b}" instead of "#var a {$$b}".  Quite a lot of commands required
  double dollar marks instead of one... Now only #alias, #action and the like
  show that behavior (because of quite obvious reasons).
* events can be now removed (#unevent)

0.3.6:                                           Wed Apr 11 12:59:35 CET 2001
* loads of bugfixes
* #dosubstitutes <var> <text> applies all substitutes to a line of text
* #dohighlights <var> <text> does the same with highlights

0.3.7:                                           Fri Apr 20 23:59:33 CET 2001
* #sortlist <var> <list>
* #match <action-like pattern> <text> <command> [#else <command if no match>]
* #decolorize <var> <text> removes all the color codes from <text>

0.3.8:                                           Mon Jul  9 13:14:49 CET 2001
* error messages are now more verbose, to make debugging scripts easier
* #shell <command> works as #system, allowing using full-screen programs
  Examples:
     #sys {echo '#var kills' `cat kills|wc -l` >tmp}
     #shell {mc}

0.3.9:                                           Fri Aug 31 22:01:31 CET 2001
* you can give multiple config files to #read on the command line
  Example:
     KBtin main pal bashes gags
     --will act as #read main;#read pal;#read bashes;#read gags
* #substitute changes only the matched part of line.
  Example:
     #sub A B
     before: xxxAyyy -> B
     now:    xxxAyyy -> xxxByyy
  To get the old behavior, use %# pattern, like #sub {%0A%0} B
* substitutes can trigger multiple times per line:
  #sub A B will result in xAxAxAxA -> xBxBxBxB

0.4.0:                                           Mon Sep 17 04:50:54 CET 2001
* TELNET protocol support.  KBtin can negotiate about terminal type, window
  size and echoing.
* "make install" should work.  At least it does so on my Debian Linux.

0.4.1:                                           Sun Jan 13 17:52:02 CET 2002
* #atoi <var> <text> can convert 42xyz -> 42
* #verbatim <line>, almost same as \<line> except for variable substitution
* #strcmp <string1> <string2> <command> [#else <command>], to cope with
  limitations of #if {[string1==string2]} (the latter doesn't allow =s, !s
  and ]s inside the strings)

0.4.2:                                           Wed Mar 27 19:37:35 CET 2002
* variable substitution, aliases and command parsing use faster data
  structures (O(1) instead of O(n)).  This usually causes your scripts
  to work at least an order of magnitude faster.
* #unpathdir was missing.  Duh.
* bugfixes, bugfixes, bugfixes
* A warning is printed if you try to define an alias containing spaces.

0.4.3:
* action/promptaction priority of 10 no longer sorts between 1 and 2
* new #message type: error.  Turn it on to prevent error messages from
  being lost even if their appropiate message type is hidden.
* #verbose allows turning the -v flag on and off
* #verbatim, #blank, #echo, #speedwalk, #togglesub, #presub and #message
  are now local to each session.

0.4.4:
* #dogoto <from> <to> [<distvar> <locvar> <pathvar>] [#else ...] will
  run an simulated #goto and retrieve the path length, visited locations
  and on-path commands.  Or, you can use "#dogoto <from> <to>" to display
  the path.
