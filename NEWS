1.0.1:
* Fixed a problem with all input being hidden on MUDs like Genesis or
  Arkadia due to telnet echo settings.
* Fixed a bug where highlights before/after a letter character didn't
  work properly ("#highlight red /d/mordor/" failed to highlight both
  "/testmud/d/mordor/" and "/d/mordor/morannon/").  Highlights inside
  a word are still suppressed, though (no "ash" inside of "Bashgeroy").

1.0.2:
* Tons of bugfixes.
* The allowed level of recursion is limited to 256.  Yeah, this can
  break some functionality, but it's better to cut off a run-away alias
  than to get a segfault.
* If your terminal happens to support underline and/or italics, you
  can use them in your highlights/whatever.  Of course, if the MUD
  happens to use these codes, they'll work, too.
