1.0.1:
* fixed a problem with all input being hidden on MUDs like Genesis or
  Arkadia due to telnet echo settings.
* fixed a bug where highlights before/after a letter character didn't
  work properly ("#highlight red /d/mordor/" failed to highlight both
  "/testmud/d/mordor/" and "/d/mordor/morannon/").  Highlights inside
  a word are still suppressed, though (no "ash" inside of "Bashgeroy").
