1.0.8:

1.0.5:
*	added a symlink kbtin -> KBtin to avoid mixed-case executable
	name while retaining old name as well
*	\e[39m, \e[49m
*	manual.html (just a converted version of the online help)

	a packet boundary
*	cleaned up command line parsing, added -q, -c, -s and -r

1.0.4:

	*	\e -> \033
	*	autoconf checks to test whether the code for inlined
		functions is actually generated
*	changes needes to compile on Cygwin:
	*	checking for stropts.h
	Note: As opposed to UNIX systems, which all enjoy the whole
	functionality, KBtin is crippled on Win32 systems.  Basically,
	while the core functionality works, #run, #system, #shell,
	#keypad, #suspend, gzip logging and COMPRESSED_HELP are broken.
	Hell, it won't even compile from the sources without your
	manipulation right now (no autoconf check to disable
	COMPRESSED_HELP).

*	#retain

1.0.3:

*	#gauge
*	#debuglog (not officially introduced as it's not finished yet)
*	bugfix: some commands ignored variables

*	bugfix: #message types were not propagated correctly to new
	sessions, that could crash KBtin
*	Nazi protection against too deep recursion.
*	bugfix: #path did something completely different than the docs said
*	added italic and underline as valid "colors"
*	when a session is started, it will inherit all settings from the
	currently active session instead of the null session

1.0.1:
*	a slight change of the logic of highlights being suppressed
	before/after alphanumeric characters
*	don't disagree when a server tells us they want to turn on echo,
	some MUDs take offense if we do
*	IRIX64 has no snprintf, cope with that

1.0.0:
*	first public release
*	the message prompting to read #news is disabled for this version

0.4.5:

*	added ^P, ^N and ^U to the editing keys
*	$IDLETIME
*	#change
*	added tab as a valid separator between command and its arguments
*	changed all(?) error messages to use tintin_eprintf() instead
	of tintin_printf().  If "#message error" is on, eprintf will

	on non-empty lines

	overloaded any longer

	semantics

*	bugfix: #gag with invalid syntax was handled incorrectly
*	removed #strip, it was completely useless
*	bugfix: {* /}, {+ -}, {<= < > >=} evaluate correctly now
*	renamed log2{html,txt} to ansi2{html,txt} and actually bundled
	them with KBtin

0.4.3:
*	action/promptaction priorities are sorted in a semi-lexicographic
	order, so numbers sort properly
*	new #message type: error (to show error messages even if they would
	be otherwise hidden)
*	#verbose
*	the following flags are now local to sessions: verbose, verbatim,
	blank, echo, speedwalk, togglesub, presub and the #message toggles
*	shell-style "!!" history commands will now obey #verbatim

0.4.2:
*	bugfix: #writeses doesn't forget about pathdirs anymore

	pathdirs

*	bugfix: #cr doesn't send two lines instead of one any longer

*	TELNET protocol support.  KBtin understands the following options:
	-	ECHO              (we attempt to turn off their echo)
	-	SUPPRESS GO AHEAD
	-	TERMINAL-TYPE     (type sent is "KBtin")
	-	NAWS              (window size updated every SIGWINCH)
*	catching SIGCONT to redraw screen after being stopped
*	--More-- kludge.  We now hide the input line by default once the
	remote end tells us to turn echo off, to protect passwords on
	non-English MUDs.
*	"make install" will install NEWS and KBtin_help.gz
*	TERM environment option in #run passed as "KBtin"

0.3.9:
*	multiple config files given from command-line when invoking KBtin
*	#sub {a} {b} works as old #sub {%1a%2} {%1b%2}
*	substitutes can trigger multiple times in a single line
	(#sub {a} {b} on "hahahaha" -> "hbhbhbhb")
*	bugfix: #action no longer segfaults
*	bugfix: changing the routes while in #goto won't crash KBtin anymore
        (we use the old data)
*	we send \r\n instead of \n, for compatibility with the telnet
	protocol (only for real sockets, of course)
*	the NEWS file is statted to tell if KBtin was updated since the
	last time you read it.  BUG: the check will fail if several users
	share the same copy of KBtin

0.3.8:
*	changed tintin_puts2 to tintin_printf through the whole source
*	more verbose error messages in most cases
*	bugfix: #verbatim can be used in the middle of an alias
*	incomplete lines are no longer considered prompts if the background
	color is non-black at the end
*	promptactions fire on "blank" with nothing but spaces and colorcodes
	only if they're complete -- to prevent expensive processing of
	highlights and substituties
*	optimized set_variable
*	buffer-overflow checks in most functions
*	aborting commands in case of a buffer overflow (incomplete!)

*	bugfix: write errors while logging no longer crash KBtin
*	#condump can dump log to a .gz file
*	changed configure.in to work with newer versions of autoconf

*	help.c now uses mypopen instead of popen to hide "Broken pipe"
	messages

*	#char now accepts also ASCII characters >127
*	all bindable keys scroll screen to the bottom of output
*	#gag and #ungag no longer touch regular substitutes
*	promptactions fire on complete lines as well
*	a quirk in VT100 standard: \n as 81th character in line should be
	ignored
*	bugfix: ${varname} with positional variables in varname
*	#dosubstitutes
*	#dohighlights
*	incomplete lines ending with one of: ?:>.*$#] are considered prompts
	and left there if the user types something
*	local echo shows color codes intact instead of changing color text
*	#run now sets the pseudo-terminal modes correctly. This means no
	double-echoing unless a stupid program like telnet changes the
	modes.
*	bugfix: #zap doesn't (hopefully) leave zombie processes anymore
*	tilde conversion in filenames: "~/" = home dir, "~user/" = user's
	home dir
*	#if substituted variables in its command part too early

0.3.5:
*	most commands substitute variables in their args
*	#help checks also the dir where KBtin binary resides
*	#removeevent can be used to remove #delays
*	#event and #unevent as other names for #delay and #remove
*	bugfix: #foreach no longer prepends space to implicit arguments

0.3.4:

        related to ioctl and pseudo-terminals)
*	delayed variable substitution - FINALLY!!!
*	#foreach can now use positional parameters instead of simple append

*	help file added

0.3.2:

        for storing values!
*	#foreach command: iterating through a list
*	bugfix: #suspend now deals properly with terminal settings

*	incoming ~n~ codes are changed to `n~ instead of working as a
        colorcode
*	unused listnode->pr fields now use 0 instead of allocating a string
	just to put "0" there (that was a waste of memory)
