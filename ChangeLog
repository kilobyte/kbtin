1.0.1:
*	a slight change of the logic of highlights being suppressed
	before/after alphanumeric characters
*	don't disagree when a server tells us they want to turn on echo,
	some MUDs take offense if we do
*	IRIX64 has no snprintf, cope with that

1.0.0:
*	first public release
*	the message prompting to read #news is disabled for this version

0.4.5:
*	man pages for ansi2txt and ansi2html
*	added ^P, ^N and ^U to the editing keys
*	$IDLETIME
*	#change
*	added tab as a valid separator between command and its arguments
*	changed all(?) error messages to use tintin_eprintf() instead
	of tintin_printf().  If "#message error" is on, eprintf will
	pierce even the !#verbose gag.
*	added ^A, ^E, ^F, ^B, ^T, ^K, ^W and ^Y, changed behavior of ^D
	on non-empty lines
*	bugfix: undefined non-alphabetic variables no longer cause
	expressions to fail
*	#send added in place of #verbatim <text>, so no #verbatim is not
	overloaded any longer
*	bugfix: resizing the window or using #status no longer screws up
	the display on SunOS
*	proper signal handling for systems where signals follow System V
	semantics
*	added support for BSD-style pseudoterminals, needed for run.c to
	compile on BSD systems

0.4.4:
*	#dogoto
*	bugfix: #ticksize 0, #ticksize 123blah
*	bugfix: #gag with invalid syntax was handled incorrectly
*	removed #strip, it was completely useless
*	bugfix: {* /}, {+ -}, {<= < > >=} evaluate correctly now
*	renamed log2{html,txt} to ansi2{html,txt} and actually bundled
	them with KBtin

0.4.3:
*	action/promptaction priorities are sorted in a semi-lexicographic
	order, so numbers sort properly
*	new #message type: error (to show error messages even if they would
	be otherwise hidden)
*	#verbose
*	the following flags are now local to sessions: verbose, verbatim,
	blank, echo, speedwalk, togglesub, presub and the #message toggles
*	csh-style "!!" history commands will now obey #verbatim

0.4.2:
*	bugfix: #writeses doesn't forget about pathdirs anymore
*	bugfix: #killall doesn't forget about binds (+plus a memory leak)
*	hash tables instead of lists for: variables, aliases, binds and
	pathdirs
*	#unpathdir
*	bugfix: lines of background color no longer appear on the screen
*	the list of commands is no longer hardcoded as a looong list of
	is_abrev()s; we use a generated hash table of code pointers instead
*	KBtin_help is now distributed in uncompressed form
*	protection against division by zero in #math and friends

0.4.1:
*	bugfix: #cr doesn't send two lines instead of one any longer
*	#atoi
*	#verbatim <line>
*	#strcmp

0.4.0:
*	TELNET protocol support.  KBtin understands the following options:
	-	ECHO              (we attempt to turn off their echo)
	-	SUPPRESS GO AHEAD
	-	TERMINAL-TYPE     (type sent is "KBtin")
	-	NAWS              (window size updated every SIGWINCH)
*	catching SIGCONT to redraw screen after being stopped
*	--More-- kludge.  We now hide the input line by default once the
	remote end tells us to turn echo off, to protect passwords on
	non-English MUDs.
*	"make install" will install NEWS and KBtin_help.gz
*	TERM environment option in #run passed as "KBtin"

0.3.9:
*	multiple config files given from command-line when invoking KBtin
*	#sub {a} {b} works as old #sub {%1a%2} {%1b%2}
*	substitutes can trigger multiple times in a single line
	(#sub {a} {b} on "hahahaha" -> "hbhbhbhb")
*	bugfix: #action no longer segfaults
*	bugfix: changing the routes while in #goto won't crash KBtin anymore
        (we use the old data)
*	we send \r\n instead of \n, for compatibility with the telnet
	protocol (only for real sockets, of course)
*	the NEWS file is statted to tell if KBtin was updated since the
	last time you read it.  BUG: the check will fail if several users
	share the same copy of KBtin

0.3.8:
*	changed tintin_puts2 to tintin_printf through the whole source
*	more verbose error messages in most cases
*	bugfix: #verbatim can be used in the middle of an alias
*	incomplete lines are no longer considered prompts if the background
	color is non-black at the end
*	promptactions fire on "blank" with nothing but spaces and colorcodes
	only if they're complete -- to prevent expensive processing of
	highlights and substituties
*	optimized set_variable
*	buffer-overflow checks in most functions
*	aborting commands in case of a buffer overflow (incomplete!)
*	#match doesn't substitute old values of variables in its command
	anymore (use $$1 to get them)
*	bugfix: #delay can be called from events without events disappearing
*	bugfix: write errors while logging no longer crash KBtin
*	#condump can dump log to a .gz file
*	changed configure.in to work with newer versions of autoconf
*	ESC[m properly recognized as ESC[0m
*	#shell
*	bugfix: \line before creating a session was improperly echoed
*	bugfix: tab (ASCII 09) characters no longer screw up linewrap
*	help.c now uses mypopen instead of popen to hide "Broken pipe"
	messages
*	workaround for systems with no *n*printf
*	ignoring errors on ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ)

0.3.7:
*	& added to the list of possible prompt chars
*	#sortlist
*	bugfix: no more segfaults in #write
*	#match
*	messages from successful calls of #system can be disabled by #mess
	#system
*	lines are joined together in #read only in case of a tintin-command
*	#decolorize

0.3.6:
*	parse.c didn't check for #unpromptaction! Aargh!
*	#char now accepts also ASCII characters >127
*	all bindable keys scroll screen to the bottom of output
*	#gag and #ungag no longer touch regular substitutes
*	promptactions fire on complete lines as well
*	a quirk in VT100 standard: \n as 81th character in line should be
	ignored
*	bugfix: ${varname} with positional variables in varname
*	#dosubstitutes
*	#dohighlights
*	incomplete lines ending with one of: ?:>.*$#] are considered prompts
	and left there if the user types something
*	local echo shows color codes intact instead of changing color text
*	#run now sets the pseudo-terminal modes correctly. This means no
	double-echoing unless a stupid program like telnet changes the
	modes.
*	bugfix: #zap doesn't (hopefully) leave zombie processes anymore
*	tilde conversion in filenames: "~/" = home dir, "~user/" = user's
	home dir

*	#event and #unevent as other names for #delay and #remove

0.3.4:
*	KBtin now compiles with -Wall with almost no warnings (save for those
        related to ioctl and pseudo-terminals)
*	delayed variable substitution - FINALLY!!!
*	#foreach can now use positional parameters instead of simple append
*	spaces between the command and first argument are not ignored if it's
        a MUD command
