Q: Is there a Windows version?
A: Not oficially.  While KBtin is known to work on CygWin, that's not
   an oficially supported platform, and don't expect KBtin to be as
   functional, fast and stable as on real UNIX systems.
   Your mileage may wary, but executing KBtin from an already running
   CygWin shell tends to give the best effects.

   Features that are known to cause problems are #keypad, #suspend,
   COMPRESSED_HELP, and (when running as a standalone process) #run,
   #system, #shell and .gz logging.


Q: Will MCCP, MXP or <insert proprietary protocol here> be implemented?
A: No.
   While these protocols can be used for interesting stuff, they suffer
   from several design flaws that make it possible on MUDs which don't
   implement these protocols to crash any clients that use them.
   Believe me, you don't want to see someone crashing you (or even worse,
   taking over control!) by simply sending you a specially crafted tell.


Q: Why KBtin doesn't auto-save my aliases and other things?
A: Without some form of GUI, your settings would be pretty unmanageable
   if dumped all together into a single file in a random order.  It is
   a lot better to have your scripts edited with a text editor outside
   KBtin and then read using #read.  Once you have more than a bunch of
   aliases/actions/whatever, you will probably want to modularize by
   #reading multiple files from a master file.
   Or, you can ignore the above, and simply:
       #hook close {#write myconfig}
